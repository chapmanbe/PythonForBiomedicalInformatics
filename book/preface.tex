\section*{The history of this book}

This books is a mdofication, on his suggestion, of Allen Downey's \emph{Think Python} which he released with a Gnu open source license. A similar modification of the book was done by Charles Severance, which he titled \emph{Python for Informatics: Exploring Information, an open textbook}. I'm following the styel of Severance's modification in order to not blame Allen for any of my poor modifications, while crediting him for the original content and structure.
